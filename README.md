The rapid and accurate estimation of earthquake magnitude is a cornerstone of effective early warning and hazard mitigation strategies. While machine learning (ML) offers a promising avenue for advancing predictive capabilities, the high dimensionality of seismic data presents a significant computational and analytical challenge. This study systematically evaluates the efficacy of three prominent metaheuristic algorithms—Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)—as feature selection wrappers for improving earthquake magnitude prediction. Four distinct ML models were benchmarked: Random Forest (RF), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a standalone Decision Tree (DT). These models were trained and evaluated on a seismic dataset comprising 1000 events characterized by 598 features. Model performance was rigorously assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Coefficient of Determination (R^2), feature reduction rates, and total execution time. The results demonstrate that the integration of metaheuristic feature selection can yield substantial performance gains, particularly for complex ensemble and kernel-based models. PSO consistently emerged as the superior optimization strategy, striking an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and model parsimony. The PSO-optimized Random Forest model achieved the best overall performance, with an MSE of 0.0284 and an R^2 of 0.8547, representing a 23.8% improvement in MSE over its baseline. Feature selection proved to be a critical enabler for the SVM, transforming it from a non-performing model (R^2= −0.1716) into a viable predictor, with the PSO-optimized variant achieving an R^2 of 0.6517. In a notable counter-example, all feature selection methods were found to be detrimental to the performance of the single Decision Tree, highlighting the algorithm-specific nature of optimization benefits. The findings conclude that a PSO-based feature selection wrapper offers a robust and highly effective method for enhancing the accuracy and computational efficiency of advanced ML models for seismic analysis, providing critical guidance for the development of next-generation earthquake early warning systems.
