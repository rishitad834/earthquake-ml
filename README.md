# earthquake-rf
This Python script implements earthquake magnitude prediction using a Random Forest Regressor. It loads earthquake data, preprocesses it by dropping unnecessary columns and encoding categorical features, then applies feature scaling. The model uses GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization and evaluates performance with multiple metrics.
